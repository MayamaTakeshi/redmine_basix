# redmine_basix

This is a Redmine plugin for integration with Basix PBX.

To install it, do it as usual:
  - go to your redmine/plugins folder
  - clone this repo
  - restart redmine
  
Ex:
```
  cd redmine/plugins/
  git clone https://github.com/brastelcloud/redmine_basix
```

It permits to initiate calls by clicking on icons that will show up in the pages:

![basix_redmine phone_icons](./images/redmine_basix.phone_icons.png)

But it also converts comments' wav, mp3, ogg links to audio tags so that the files can be listened to without leaving the current page.

To remove this plugin just delete folder redmine/plugins/redmine_basix
