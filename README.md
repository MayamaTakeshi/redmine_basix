# redmine_basix

This is a Redmine plugin for integration with Basix PBX.

To install it, do it as usual:
  - go to your redmine/plugins folder
  - clone this repo
  - restart redmine
  
Ex:
```
  cd redmine/plugins/
  git clone https://github.com/brastelcloud/redmine_basix
```

Currently, the main purpose of this plugin is to permit automation of integration configuration due to limitations in the Redmine REST API.

But it also converts comments' wav, mp3, ogg links to audio tags so that the files can be listened to without leaving the current page.
