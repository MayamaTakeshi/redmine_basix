# redmine_basix

This is a Redmine plugin for integration with Basix PBX.

To install it, do it as usual:
  - go to your redmine/plugins folder
  - clone this repo
  
Ex:
```
  cd redmine/plugins/
  git clone https://github.com/brastelcloud/redmine_basix
```

Currently, the only purpose of this plugin is to permit automation of integration configuration due to limitations in the Redmine REST API.
